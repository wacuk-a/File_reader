# File Reader & Modifier (Beginner Version)

This is a simple Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a file name to read.
2. Reads the file and shows its content.
3. Converts the text to **uppercase**.
4. Saves the modified text to a new file.
5. Handles errors if the file cannot be opened.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the Python file (e.g., `file_editor.py`) in your folder.
3. Have a text file ready (example: `input.txt`) in the same folder.
4. Run the program in the terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python file_editor.py
